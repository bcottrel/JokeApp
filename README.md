Joke application I created to test out asp.net features. 

azure website: https://brianjokeapp.azurewebsites.net/

*I need to whitelist ip's for someone to see the website's data and for the website to function in any capacity.* 

Resources needed to run;

*.net 6

*visual studio 2022

To test in visual studio, a user will need to make a SQL database and link it in appsettings.json as a connection string.
